## Hi, I'm Umer Khan!
<!-- **my bio and stats -->
👨🏻‍💻 Software Engineer sharing my tech journey, discoveries, and insights as I build and learn along the way.<br>
🤖 I’ve caught the coding bug and now I’m loving every moment of it.<br>
💱 I’m diving into PHP and custom WordPress plugin development—still getting my feet wet, but I’m making great strides.<br>
💭 Sometimes I think my computer is getting tired of me constantly tinkering with WordPress plugins and PHP code. I swear, it’s started giving me side-eye when I ask for more ‘just one more’ test run!<br>
